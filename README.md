# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone built with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX on the client-side, and Node, Express and MongoDB on the server-side.

This project was developed as part of Lighthouse Labs' Web Development Bootcamp program, and it is focused mainly in  practicing front-end skills.

For every tweet that is made, the server will create a random user to attach to it.
